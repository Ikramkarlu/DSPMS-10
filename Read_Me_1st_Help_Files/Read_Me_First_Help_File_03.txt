Now admin panel working fully!

import new database to ur system. new database is in dabase folder and the file name is Database_03

admin login is "admin"
and admin password is also "admin"

Now tutor, supervisor and student panels are also working except the manage project option not working.

user names are following
---------------------------------
tutor login = "tutor1"
tutor password = "tutor1"

supervisor = "supervisor1"
supervisor password = "supervisor1"

student login = "student1"
student password = "student1"

Manage project is the most difficult option in this project. Hope I will add this as early as possible.
